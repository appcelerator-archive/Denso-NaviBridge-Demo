This project runs on Alloy and requires a little work before firing it up (because I didn't want to add huge files to the Git repo).

Steps to get set up:

(1) Import the project to Titanium Studio 
(2) Add a folder named "Resources" at the root of the project
(3) Inside of the project directory, run the command "alloy compile"
(4) Run the app in the simulator

Currently tested on TIMOB 2.1.3GA, iPhone-only (5.X).
